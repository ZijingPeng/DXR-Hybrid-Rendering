## Introduction

This project is to implement a hybrid rendering pipeline that combines both rasterization and raytracing to generate real-time effects. This hybrid rendering pipeline is built based on EA's [PICA PICA](https://www.ea.com/seed/news/seed-project-picapica) project. The pipeline includes multiple passes -- shadow, ambient occlusions, direct lighting and reflection. To denoise our results, we also implemented a SVGF filter. 

## Prerequisites

- Windows 10 version 1809 or newer
- Visual Studio 2019
- [Microsoft Windows SDK version 1903 (10.0.18362.1)](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/sdk-archive)

## Features

### Pipeline

### Shadow

Shadows are implemented by launching rays towards the light source. To create soft penumbra shadows, we cast rays by sampling in the shape of a cone.

| Hard Shadow              | Soft Shadow (100 spp) |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- |

To filter the shadows, we applied a SVGF-based filter. 

| Raytraced Shadow (1 spp) | Raytraced Shadow with Filter (1 ssp) |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |

### Ambient Occlusion

We did not implement global illumination in this project, ambient occlusion is used to add realism to our renders. We also used the SVGF-based filter for denoising AO results.

| Ambient Occlusion (1 ssp) | Ambient Occlusion with filter (1 spp) |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| ![](/img/ao.png)          | ![](/img/ao_svgf.png)                 |

### Reflection

To create a nice visual effect of reflection, we first sampled the normal distribution at the intersection of the specular surface. With this sampled normal, we could launch a reflected ray and collect the information when it first hit another object. We used the Halton sequence for sampling because it is well distributed for low and high sample counts.

Another SVGF-based filter is applied for denoising the result.

| Reflection (1 ssp)       | Reflection with filter (1 spp) |
